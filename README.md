## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
You are in my personal Github account where I share my programming projects, games and applications. As a game development enthusiast, I have been messing up with coding over a couple years. If you click on the "Repositories" tab in my profile, what you will find there is a complete mess. So, I would like to list my projects and explain what I am doing for you to have a comfortable look at my experience for whatever the reason you are here for.

## Who am I?
### Short introduction
I'm Yasin, a 19 years old game development enthusiast from Istanbul. I started coding with Java when I was at my mid 15s back then, it was a part of my unconscious career search. I have done a couple simple projects such as a calculator using Java, though I neither have the projects nor I would like to share them publicly since they are mostly incredibly inefficient. Knowing Java was a good thing, because I helped my older friends who needed some help on their Uni assignments(for some bucks off course :p).

### My journey of game development
#### It all started with a mess
Though, I was a person who were actively playing video games at my mid 16. And making projects in Java was a mess because of it's terrible visual libraries(my opinion:)). Even if the visual libraries of Java are not that bad, I had a trauma because of the project(![WarplanB](https://github.com/YasinAhmet/WarplanB)) I tried to make when I was still a beginner. I developed the project in my early 17s, and it was basically a frame for wargames(a strategy game type). The project reached it's target, but the fact that I wasn't aware of what I am doing resulted in a mess.

#### And started to take a form
So to get access to better tools and opportunities I decided to hop into C# and start learning Unity to hit two targets with one arrow! In that way, I got rid of Java mess and started learning Unity to develop some video games. At first, I helped a phd student on completing his educational project in Unity. Then, I started making stuff on my own. I made a short game with no assets in a week at my 17, which should be considered a bad game in any manner(![Gunman](https://github.com/YasinAhmet/theGUNMAN). 

#### Became better than the previous
Following that project, I hopped into another(![Tycoonis](https://github.com/YasinAhmet/Tycoonis)) which is far better and complicated than the previous in both mechanical and visual way. The game had an economy. Resource exchange and management, buildings and various other features are in the game. Compared to the previous game, this one is great. There was a new popular concept at that time which is AI content. Back then, I decided to use AI art in my game. Icons, pop-up images and most of these art stuff were made with AI! Following that, I learnt Proton basics with a ![Monopoly Prototype](https://youtu.be/xKpALXtAejA)!

#### Then something happened
I had been going to events about game development since I had been making the Tycoonis prototype. They had an incubation program(![OGEM](https://ogem.istanbul/)) to make up startup teams for video game projects and help them in their progress. My team(![Renludus](https://www.linkedin.com/company/renludus/)) got accepted into the incubation program and we had a 6 months of game development adventure. Besides of ![The Game](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d18b9dI5pBk), I got better with Unity and learnt UE5 during the incubation. Because the organizators purpose was that as well. Our team even participated in a gaming fair in Istanbul which is [Gaming Istanbul'23](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/803750186811392044/1249335024969318410/20230923_1350040.jpg?ex=6666ed69&is=66659be9&hm=3a150d4bd626eed0574fa888e014adb774376fcda0b714eddc75ac72ca7408b6&). ![Just a video of the cute doggie from our workplace](https://github.com/YasinAhmet/YasinAhmet/blob/main/VID_20230622_101006.mp4)

![We participated in a jam, Magara Jam'23!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_5JojEbNE1M)

#### And I realized every good thing has an end.
But time passed and the team fell apart, as the organizators guessed the project maintained by the unexperienced developers left uncompleted in the deep sea of "New Project"s. All left from the project is the experience we gained from it. I made an ![Electrical Devices Prototype](https://youtu.be/To-IN9k8qWU) and a ![Darkest Dungeon Prototype](https://github.com/YasinAhmet/YasinAhmet/blob/main/2023-10-25_16-48-58.mp4) meanwhile the period of the team's falling apart. I kept going on myself and worked with an agency when I was 18 through a one time contract to make various mini games on educational purposes for the ministry of education. Maybe it's a curse I am not sure, but the ministry left the project in half and didn't pay the other half we agreed for. So these projects are left as well. Though, some of them are in good condition and actually playable especially for children:

1. ![Complete the Paint](https://yasinahmet.github.io/SekilDoldurma/): You have to complete the paint given to you by using the palette. %90 completed, sounds and some minor problems exist.
2. ![Fill the Basket](https://yasinahmet.github.io/SepetDoldurma/): You have a basket and you have to fill it based on the orders given to you. Keep in mind that the orders are in Turkish. %90 completed.
3. ![Grip Order](https://yasinahmet.github.io/TokaYerlestirme/): You pick a hair and fill the consecutive gaps of grips on the hair. %80 completed, the game may be a little bit too hard for the target audience. 
4. ![Clock Manager](https://yasinahmet.github.io/SaatTahmin/): There is a manual clock and some modern clocks in the game. You try to match the manual clock's time with modern clocks times. For the first five round, you do that by clicking the right modern clocks. For the next 5 rounds, you do that by fixing the manual clock's time by dragging your mouse while clicking the manual clock to the target time. %80 completed, but I am not sure what the hell this game is going to teach the children.
5. ![Geometry Game](https://yasinahmet.github.io/Geometri/): You fill the box space given on the right with geometry shapes. %70 completed, the UI sucks.

#### What am I doing about game development currently?
I am still learning and getting progress on game development. I hopped into Godot to see their ways of game development, and I liked it! I made a simple arcade game in it recently, which you can reach from (![here](https://yasinahmet.itch.io/wave-crawler)). I will be moving on with Godot for a while and make a couple projects such as Wave Crawler. Nowadays I am trying to gain money through freelancing, but haven't got successful on it somehow. Still, not gonna give up on freelancing.
